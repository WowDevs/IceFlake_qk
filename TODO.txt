What needs to be done:
=======================

Refactoring a lot of the logic. The EndScene handling can be improved by great lengths, but this goes beyond my capacity.
The code needs to be more consistent in style and design. Do we go for OOP or more of the static classes?

************

Most of the code here was taken from a project meant for later versions of WoW.
Many changes have been applied since 3.3.5a and a bunch of stuff needs to be backported.

- Inventory (see WoWLocalPlayer.cs and WoWItem.cs)
	Basicly, all the WDB stuff (i.e. ItemRec and ItemRecSparse)

- Drawing in-game
	Mostly just finding and updating the pointers

- Implement direct packet interception?
	If it should be needed (see ClientServices.cs)

- Make a proper Movement helper
	To be able to properly support PPather

- Refactor the DBC reader?

- Implement & Improve World functions
	Referring to World.cs

- Add a plugin/scripting system
	Backup plan: Use old one

- Double check and verify the structures and constants we have

************

PPather needs a proper implementation and optimization.
The project shut down in WotLK so it shouldn't be that much of a hassle.
However, now it needs to be able to handled being injected and locked MPQ files.
